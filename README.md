# TreeMail
A prototype for a new type of email client interface.

Email is ubiquitous but existing interfaces are clumsy and confusing. TreeMail will try to challenge the traditional way of looking at long email chains by implementing a much more intuitive user interface.

This project is developed in Python, using tkinter to create the GUI.

More info on the project and the new interface is coming soon!

If you have ideas or like this project, feel free to contribute!
